# Period charges
[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The topic in this article provides information about **Period charges** which provide the ability to charge customers upon orders invoiced in a specific period that did not meet certain criteria. The feature supports setting up  period charge rules which identify such invoices and define applicable charges. Charges can be calculated upon minimum charge amount (for example: minimum delivery fee), minimum order quantity, or combination of both.

## Enable Period charges
In order to leverage period charges, enable the feature 'Period charges' in feature management.

When this feature is enabled, new settings are availble from accounts receivable parameters to control the period charge calculations. Also when this feature is enabled, changes are made to the  **Accounts receivable \> Invoices \> All free text invoice** Free text invoice details page to accomodate for free text invoices created for period charges. New page **Period charge rule** is added to **Accounts receivable \> Charges setup**, and new page **Calculate period charge** is added to **Accounts receivable \> Periodic tasks**.
 
## Working with Period charges
Go to **Accounts receivable \> Setup \> Accounts receivable parameters**.
1. Open the **Prices** tab.
2. On the **Charges** fasttab, make the following settings:
    - **Quantity thredshold source** – Choose which types of lines to consider when calculating quantity-based period charge rules. Select "Sales order lines" to consider sales order line quantities (including cancelled sales order lines). Select "Invoice lines" to consider invoice line quantities instead. The general recommendation is to set this to "Invoice lines" unless the business requirements require otherwise.
    - **Site and warehouse source** – Choose where to match site and warehouse values set as selection criteria in period charge rules. Select "Invoice line" to match values set in individual invoice lines (in the CustInvoiceTrans table). Select "Sales order" to instead match values set in the sales order header (in the SalesTable table). The general recommendation is to set this to "Invoice line" unless the business requirements require otherwise. 
    - **Required charge code match** – Set this value to No, if the period charge rule calculation for a line type monetary threshold or quantity threshold minimum amount does not require at least one invoice line charge matching the charge code on the rule line for a free text invoice line to be created. Set this value to Yes, if the period charge rule calculation for a line type monetary threshold or quantity threshold minimum amount requires at least one invoice line charge matching the charge code on the rule line for a free text invoice line to be created. The general recommendation is to set this to "Yes" unless the business requirements require otherwise. 
- **Extra batch helpers** – Enter a value to add batch helpers for load balancing when period charge calculation is run in a batch. Batch helpers are also referred to as threads.

### Set up period charge rule
Use this procedure to define period charge rules for customers, site and warehouse. Period charges are applied when you run calculate period charge batch for a period. You can define period charge rules for specific customer, site, or warehouse or for groups of customer, site, or warehouse. You can also define period charges that apply to all customers, site, or warehouse.
 
Go to **Accounts receivable \> Charges Setup \> period charge rule*
1.	Click **New** to define a new period charge rule. Enter Name and description of the rule.
2.	Select the date in **From invoice date** and **To invoice date** for which this period charge rule is valid. 
3.	Select an account in the **Account code** field from the following values:
    Table – Assign charges to a specific customer.
    Group – Assign charges to a miscellaneous charges group.
    All – Assign charges to all customers.
4.	In the **Customer relation** field, select a specific customer if you selected Table, or select a customer charges group if you selected Group.
6.	Select value in **Site**, keep it blank in case you want this rule to be applicable for all sites.
7.	Select value in **Warehouse**, keep it blank in case you want this rule to be applicable for all warehouses.
8.	Click **Add** button available under the Lines fast tab and configure the values as per the **Type** of the threshold.

#### Period charge rule

**Name**                          The name of the period charge rule.
**Description**          	        A short description of the period charge rule.
**From invoice date**          	  The invoice date from which this period charge rule is valid.
**To invoice date**          	    The invoice date up to which this period charge rule is valid.
**Account code**          	      The scope of customers to whom this period charge rule should apply. Select "Table" to apply the rule
                                  only to the customer selected in the "Customer relation" field. Select "All" to apply the rule to all
                                  customers.
**Account relation**              If **Account code** is set to 'Table', then this field specifies the customer account that this
                                  period charge rule applies to. If 'Account code' is set to 'All', then the rule will apply to all
                                  customers and this field will be blank.
**Site**	                        The site where this period charge rule applies. If this field is blank, then the rule will apply to
                                  all sites. Whether this setting is applied to sales order header or invoice line is determined by the
                                  Site and warehouse source value. If a site is specified, then the current period charge rule will
                                  only apply to either customer invoice lines with this same site, or to invoice lines related to a
                                  sales order with this same site on the sales order header.
**Warehouse**                     The warehouse where this period charge rule applies. If this field is blank, then the rule will
                                  apply to all warehouses. Whether this setting is applied to sales order header or invoice line is 
                                  determined by the Site and warehouse source value. If a warehouse is specified, then the current
                                  period charge rule will only apply to either customer invoice lines with this same warehouse, or to
                                  invoice lines related to a sales order with this same warehouse on the sales order header.
**Type**                          The type of period charge rule line. Select **Monetary threshold** to create a rule line that
                                  calculates the monetary value of qualifying charges, establishes minimum monetary thresholds for each
                                  charge type, and generates a free text invoice line that charges the shortfall for customers who
                                  don't meet the thresholds during the period. Select **Quantity threshold** to create a rule line that
                                  calculates the total sold quantity of qualifying items, establishes a minimum quantity threshold, and
                                  generates a free text invoice line with a fixed charge for customers who don't meet the threshold
                                  during the period. Select **Quantity threshold minimum amount** to create a rule line that includes
                                  both quantity and monetary thresholds.

Note that thresholds for all three types are transaction line based: Either based on line quantities (sales order line or invoice line) or line monetary values (charge line for invoice line)

**Monetary threshold**            The monetary threshold at which a rule line applies. If the period charge calculation finds that the
                                  sum of qualifying line charges charged to a customer over the period is below this threshold, then
                                  the system will generate a free text invoice line with a charge equal to the shortfall.
**Currency**	                    The currency for the **Monetary threshold** field value. This currency will also be used as a
                                  selection criterion, so a period charge rule line will only be evaluated against charge lines for
                                  invoice lines that use this same currency. The related free text invoice line generated for the
                                  customer will also use this currency.
**Charge code**                   The type of charge for which a period charge rule line applies (such as freight, installation, or
                                  handling).
**Include debit charge amount only**  Controls which types of invoice line charges to include when calculating against the monetary
                                  threshold for a rule line. For rule lines where this check box is selected, the calculation will only
                                  include invoice line charges where the value is a debit (positive). For rule lines where this check
                                  box isn't selected, the calculation will include all invoice line charges, regardless of the value
                                  sign (debit/positive or credit/negative).
**Quantity threshold**	          The quantity threshold at which a rule line applies. If the period charge calculation finds that the
                                  total qualifying quantities ordered by a customer during the period is below this threshold, then the
                                  system will generate a free text invoice line with a charge equal to the charge amount specified by
                                  the rule line.
**Unit**	                        The unit of measure used for the "Quantity threshold" field value. This unit of measure will also be
                                  used as a selection criterion, so a period charge rule line will only be evaluated against order or
                                  invoice line quantities that use either this same unit or another unit that can be converted to it
                                  using a conversion factor defined in the system.

Note that standard unit of measure rounding rules apply when unit of measure conversion is required. 

**Include debit quantity only**   Controls which types of sales order or invoice lines to include when calculating against the quantity
                                  threshold for a rule line. For rule lines where this check box is selected, the calculation will only 
                                  include sales order or invoice lines where the value is a debit (positive). For rule lines where this
                                  check box isn't selected, the calculation will include sales order or all invoice lines, regardless
                                  of the value sign (debit/positive or credit/negative).
**Charge amount**                 The amount that a customer will be charged for a period for rule lines of type "Quantity threshold”,
                                  when the quantity threshold is not met for a rule line. This amount will appear as a fixed fee on the
                                  related free text invoice line for the relevant customer.
**Currency for charge amount**    The currency used for the charge amount for rule lines of type "Quantity threshold". This applies to
                                  the related free text invoice line and isn't used as a selection criterion.
**Revenue account**               The revenue account that will be defaulted onto the free text invoice line created by a period
                                  charge rule line.
**Description**                   The description that will be defaulted on the related free text invoice line created by a rule.

## Calculate Period charge
After period charge rule setup is complete, use the Calculate Period charge page to calculate Period charge. Calculate period charge will create free text invoice if there will be shortfall between the configured threshold on Period charge rule setup and total charges/quantity processed on sales transactions for a period.
Calculate period charge process can be executed from user session, or it can be configured as batch job.
•	Click Accounts receivable > Periodic tasks > Calculate period charge.
•	Parameters are available on this batch to control the period charge calculation. 


**Calculate period charge**
**Customer account**          Albeit the label states customer account, the account selected will be an invoice account to calculate
                              period charges. Only invoices for this particular invoice account will be considered in the calculate
                              period charges run. Leave this blank to calculate period charges for all accounts.  
**Rule name**                 Select a rule name to calculate period charges for that rule only. Leave this blank to calculate period
                              charges for all rules
**From invoice date**         Select the first invoice date to include in the period charge calculation. If you are setting up a
                              recurring job, you should leave this blank and use the "Max invoice age" setting instead.
**To invoice date**           Select the last invoice date to consider in the period charge calculation. If you are setting up a
                              recurring job, you should leave this blank and use the "Max invoice age" setting instead.
**Max invoice age**	          Specify the maximum age (in days) of invoices to include in the period charge calculation. The
                              calculation will consider all invoice lines that are this old or younger on the day the calculation runs.
**Days per free text invoice** Specify the number of days to cover with each free text invoice generated by the period charge
                              calculation.
